Authorities say a firing squad killed Abed Abdul Razak Kamel in the central prison of Yemen's Ibb province Monday, one day after President Ali Abdullah Saleh endorsed his death sentence. Kamel opened fire on American medical staff at a Baptist hospital in the southern Yemen town of Jibla. Authorities believe he may have been part of or linked to a terror network.
