China's giant pandas have been on endangered species lists for nearly 30 years. There are only about 1,600 pandas still living in the wild in China. One of the 2008 Olympic mascots is modeled on a panda called Jing Jing. Conservationists hope she will help draw attention to the threats facing the giant panda -- one of China's national symbols. Sam Beattie reports from Jing Jing's home in Sichuan province.

A landmine blast in southern Afghanistan has killed nine Afghan soldiers. The Taleban later claimed responsibility for the blast in Kandahar province. An Afghan Army spokesman said the troops were traveling towards the nearby Pakistani border when their vehicle hit the mine. U.S.-led forces are hunting down remnants of Afghanistan's ousted Taleban regime who frequently carry out hit and run attacks on coalition and Afghan government forces, mainly in the country's eastern and southern regions.

The Who cancelled a March 13 concert in Tampa, Florida, after lead singer Roger Daltrey fell ill. The 63-year-old Daltrey walked offstage during the first song; guitarist Pete Townshend later told the crowd he was suffering from bronchitis and could barely speak. The crowd of 9,000 then cheered when Townshend said the show had been rescheduled for March 25. The Who is currently touring in support of Endless Wire, its first album since 1982. The band next performs March 17 in Mexico City.

The price of crude oil dropped more than two percent in New York trading Wednesday, falling to the lowest level in about a month.  The price of a barrel of crude oil for future delivery was off nearly $2 and went as low as $73.83.    The decline came as a government report said the total supply of crude oil and refined fuels in the United States was more than 1.1 billion barrels, the highest level in at least two decades.  An abundant supply of petroleum products generally pushes prices downward.

China's first private airline is expected to take to the skies this year. The official Xinhua news agency says Sunday Okay Airways is undergoing a final official review, and should be cleared to begin operations after Nov. 20. Xinhua said the Beijing-based airline plans to lease six U.S.-made Boeing 737 aircraft for domestic cargo and passenger charter flights. Two other private airlines, United Eagle Airlines and Air Spring, reportedly hope to begin flying next year, once a review of their applications is completed by the Civil Aviation Administration of China.

Two years ago, war broke out along Israel's border with Lebanon. The conflict known as the Second Lebanon War started after Hezbollah guerrillas attacked an Israeli patrol and seized two Israeli soldiers.  On July 14, Hezbollah returned the bodies of the two Israeli soldiers in a prisoner exchange with the Jewish state.  No Israeli town was more affected by the war than Metullah, the closest Israeli town to Lebanon.  Jim Teeple recently visited the town where many residents say they want a lasting peace with Lebanon.

French President Jacques Chirac has offered his support for Croatia's aspirations for European Union membership. Mr. Chirac told visiting Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sander that the schedule for membership talks should be respected. Croatia's EU membership negotiations began in October after an eight-month delay due to the country's failure to capture a top suspect wanted by the United Nations war crimes tribunal. Mr. Chirac says Croatia's rapid economic development and progress in reforms justified the start of the country's membership negotiations with the bloc.

Last month, a United Nations conference in Rome discussed the world's rising food prices.  The group called for trade barriers to be reduced and food export bans to be lifted.  The cost of major food commodities has doubled over the past two years with rice, corn and wheat at record highs.   The Philippines and Haiti, among other countries, have been hard-hit. Some Filipino and Haitian immigrants in the United States are sending food to their families back home.  VOA's Deborah Block has the story.

Suspected militants in Pakistan have blown up 36 oil tankers that supply fuel to U.S.-led forces in neighboring Afghanistan. Pakistani officials Monday said the attackers set off two bombs near the trucks, triggering fires and explosions Sunday night in the Khyber tribal district. At least 70 people were wounded. More than 80 oil tankers bound for Afghanistan were parked in the area when the explosion happened. No one has claimed responsibility.

Authorities have lost control of a southern Afghanistan district after Taleban fighters attacked and disarmed police late Thursday. Reports from Musa Qala in the southern province of Helmand say hundreds of Taleban fighters seized the town, destroying part of its district headquarters. The Associated press quotes a spokesman for NATO forces in Afghanistan, Colonel Tom Collins, as saying an unknown number of militants apparently entered Musa Qala. British forces pulled out of the town last year after a peace deal was signed between local elders and the Helmand provincial government.

Estonian President Arnold Ruutel has formally approved the country's new government, three weeks after the previous ruling coalition collapsed. The president's action followed a parliamentary vote confirming Andrus Ansip and his coalition government. The 48-year-old Mr. Ansip was the minister of economics and communications minister in the previous government. The new coalition brings together Mr. Ansip's Reform Party, the Centre Party and the People's Union. Estonia's previous prime minister, Juhan Parts, resigned last month after lawmakers voted no-confidence in his justice minister.

The Iraqi government has ordered the pan-Arab satellite network Al-Arabiya to close its bureau in Baghdad for one month. Iraqi officials are quoted as saying the ban is because of what they have described as the network's uneven reporting and unprofessional conduct in covering events in Iraq.  Dubai-based Al-Arabiya was briefly banned in November 2003 after airing an audiotape from Saddam Hussein. The U.S.-backed interim Iraqi government banned the Arabic satellite network Al-Jazeera in 2004 for allegedly inciting violence.

A lengthy struggle between France and Great Britain for the islands ended in 1814, when they were ceded to the latter. Independence came in 1976. Socialist rule was brought to a close with a new constitution and free elections in 1993. President France-Albert RENE, who had served since 1977, was re-elected in 2001, but stepped down in 2004. Vice President James MICHEL took over the presidency and in July 2006 was elected to a new five-year term.

China plans its second manned space launch later this week, with reports suggesting a Wednesday or Thursday blast-off from Inner Mongolia. Chinese space agency officials have not confirmed a date, but short-listed astronauts for the two-man mission have already arrived at the Gobi desert launch site. China launched its first manned space flight two years ago, in October 2003. The secretive space program is closely affiliated with the military and is considered a source of national prestige.
